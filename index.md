landing-title: 'Emotions in human-machine conversations. A communicative approach.'
description: 'Generative AI (GAI) is now widely used across many areas of society and. Due to low access barriers it enables users to try out various GAI applications and actively participate in creative processes. Interaction with an agent that exhibits anthropomorphic characteristics is perceived not only as low-threshold, but also as stimulating and intuitive. In the course of such human-AI interactions, there is a (sometimes unconscious) adaptation to the logic of AI systems. In co-creation processes, they adopt not only AI-generated outputs but also the implicit cultural, normative or stylistic assumptions embedded within them, contributing to the emergence of new forms of expression and communication practices. Since technologies are never neutral but always embedded in social and cultural contexts and influence existing power relations, a communication technology such as generative AI reshapes the relationship between humans, creativity, communication and reality. Emotions play a central role in this process, as they structure information exchange, mutual understanding and meaning-making. This project therefore examines how emotions are expressed in interactions with AI chatbots and how these interactions contribute to new social and cultural conditions for emotional communication.'

This project is financed by the Region Occitanie and is a collaboration between the LERASS, a social sciences lab at the Université Paul Valéry in Montpellier, and the LIRMM, a lab for informatics and robotics and comprises two PhD projects, one in communication science, that will analyze the expression of emotions in the conversations with the chatbots, and one in informatics that will focus on the emotion recognition through artificial intelligence.
