This project is financed by the Region Occitanie and is a collaboration between the LERASS, a social sciences lab at the Université Paul Valéry in Montpellier, and the LIRMM, a lab for informatics and robotics and comprises two PhD projects, one in communication science, that will analyze the expression of emotions in the conversations with the chatbots, and one in informatics that will focus on the emotion recognition through artificial intelligence.
